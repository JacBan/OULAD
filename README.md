# Online Course EDA & Course Monitoring Dashboard
Inspired by my background as an educator, I wanted to challenge myself to create a Tableau dashboard for course administrators. The dashboard would allow the course administrator to monitor registration, demographics, final results and engagement. I used Python, SQL and Tableau throughout the process.

## Project status:
Revision and final clean up.

## Steps in this project:
Step 1: I performed an exploratory data analysis on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) using Python in order to understand the quality, composition and results of the data,

Step 2: then I installed a SQL server and using Python, I programmatically imported the final dataset,

Step 3: I then used SQL to test the feasibility of various online course monitoring indicators,

Step 4: and finally I created the Tableau course monitoring dashboard.
